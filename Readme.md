AppLaud App
============================

The AppLaud App version 1.1 is an Android App that works with [AppLaud Cloud](http://www.applaudcloud.com) 
to create a fast Android development environment.

The AppLaud App has two main functionalities - each represented by a navigation page.

* The My Apps Page works in conjunction with the AppLaud Cloud to run and
debug a developers project. It can run pure JavaScript Android
PhoneGap apps directly from the cloud. No download or install is
necessary. The Download APKs feature enables downloading and running any built
Android app in the developer's workspace on the device.
* The Demo Page will run or download several different apps that
illustrate PhoneGap and jQuery Mobile's capabilities.
